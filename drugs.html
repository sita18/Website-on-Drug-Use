        <p>Drug misuse is when you use legal or illegal substances in ways you shouldn’t. You might take more than the regular dose of pills or use someone else’s prescription. You may misuse drugs to feel good, ease stress, or avoid reality. But usually, you’re able to change your unhealthy habits or stop using altogether.Addiction is when you can’t stop. Not when it puts your health in danger. Not when it causes financial, emotional, and other problems for you or your loved ones. That urge to get and use drugs can fill up every minute of the day, even if you want to quit.Addiction also is different from physical dependence or tolerance. In cases of physical dependence, withdrawal symptoms happen when you suddenly stop a substance. Tolerance happens when a dose of a substance becomes less effective over time.When you use opioids for pain for a long time, for example, you may develop tolerance and even physical dependence. This doesn’t mean you’re addicted. In general, when narcotics are used under proper medical supervision, addiction happens in only a small percentage of people.In New Zealand around 12% of the population are estimated to experience a substance use disorder in their lifetime. 11 ofThis group are likely to benefit from treatment such as group therapy, individual coun- selling, detoxification, opioid substitution treatment, and residential in-patient treatment programmes.The latest report known in the use of drug abuse here in New Zealand today is that 7.4% of all ages 12 and older. 4.5% of ages 12-17. 14.1% of ages 18-25. 6.7% of people 26 and older.After constructing the population in the IDI and filtering down to those between 18 and 65 who were Māori or Pākehā, we had a population of 4,600,000 people, of whom 546,879 were Māori and 50% were women (Table 1). The proportion of people who had any cannabis charges that proceeded to the courts was less than 1% across all ethnicities, but due to the large population, counts were adequate for logistic regression as there were over 2,000 charges.</p>

      <div class="text2"><p>Drug abuse for New Zealmd Immigrants are some people is usinfg drug abuse due to their way of living for example some people use drug abuse as their source of money beacuse they are unemployed or poor because drugs is one of the fastest way to earn money.The lower risks of substance use for the first‐generation immigrants compared to their non‐immigrant peers, combined with the overall trends towards similar risks of substance use for second‐generation immigrants and non‐immigrants supports the immigrant paradox.It appears that differing levels of acculturation are contributing to the differences between first‐generation and non‐immigrant youth groups for risks of substance use, which is not the case for second‐generation immigrants. However, the extent to which the relationships between immigrant generation and risks of substance use were influenced by acculturation variables could not be explored adequately given the relatively imprecise estimates in statistical models in a study that was not powered to undertake such analyses. Drawing on the findings from previous research,there is a need to further explore in more focused studies the factors that may mediate the pathway through which newer migrants retain or lose the protective effect of lower risks of substance use.
